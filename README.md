# Black-Ops-1-Camo-Pack
A mashup created for a few friends to use, but now you can as well! :)

## How this works
For those of you who are not aware, when you create a new .iwd file at the end of the rest in your game's "main" folder, essentially placing this one will override the textures, giving you a nice looking camo pack!

## Installation Instructions
- Go to where Black Ops is installed.

- Navigate to the "main" folder.

- Drop [this](https://github.com/ohMarcel/Black-Ops-1-Camo-Pack/releases/download/v1.0/iw_42.iwd) IWD file in there, and run Black Ops! To revert it, simply just delete the iw_42.iwd file.

## Credits
None of these textures are my own, they are simply one I threw together for a few friends from Gashy's camo pack.
